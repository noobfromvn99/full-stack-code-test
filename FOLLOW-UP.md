# What libraries did you add? What are they used for?
- FontAwesomeIcons: for some icons to use in the app
- Bootstrap: to apply responsive layout for the web
- Axios: to fetch data from API
- eslint and prettier: To help write code conventionally
# If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
- I would improve the UI of the app, add pagination for the app. If possible I would like to add prediction of the weather into the app.
# Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
In this project, I tried to make everything in a single page. You can sort the data as well as filter it at the same time and it is single page only.
# Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
The part I spent most time with is sorting data and the most difficult part is informimg the user when the data was last updated from the server because I don't really know how to test that.
# How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
The test was quiet fun. I had experience with Vuejs before but this is the first time I using Nuxt for server side rendering. I can see the data was old and some data is missing some of its properties.
